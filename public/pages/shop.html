      <h1>Shop Milk</h1>
      <p>You want Milk™? We got it. So many delicious milk flavors that you won't be able to believe it. Check
        them out below, and if you don't buy at least 3, we'll send you 30 as a consolation.
        <br>
        <br>
        Milk™ is not just
        from cows, but all sorts of creatures. If you’re looking for a specific creature’s milk, let us know!

              <p>Just like Little Caesar's, this Milk is hot and ready. Straight from the pipes and piping
                hot, this Milk is full of a full-bodied, salty flavor. You'll love the way it feels when
                it
                hits your lips, and if you don't, you probably just don't like Milk in general.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, this Milk is spicy.

              <p>Not a fan of the warmth? Maybe try the cold! Our cold Milk is not fresh. It has been
                sitting
                in a cold storage container for a minimum of 4 years, ensuring that all of the little
                critters inside are dead as dead can be. If you don't like Milk, you probably won't like
                this either.

                This Milk is not spicy.

              <p>Uh oh! You've been MILKED! This Milk is gross and absolutely repulsive. It really is not
                good, and we don't recommend it. That said, some people do like it. Maybe. Honestly,
                this
                Milk is what we've had lying around leftover on the floor.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sometimes this Milk is spicy, but
                mostly due to the dirt.
