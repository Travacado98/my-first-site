      <h1>Shop Milk</h1>

      <p>You want Milk™? We got it. So many delicious milk flavors that you won't be able to believe it. Check them out
        below, and if you don't buy at least 3, we'll send you 30 as a consolation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Milk™ is not just from cows, but all sorts of creatures. If you’re looking for a specific creature’s milk, let
        us know!

            <h1 class="hot">Hot</h1>

            <p>Just like Little Caesar's, this Milk is hot and ready. Straight from the pipes and piping
              hot, this Milk is full of a full-bodied, salty flavor. You'll love the way it feels when
              it
              hits your lips, and if you don't, you probably just don't like Milk in general.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also, this Milk is spicy.

            <p>Not a fan of the warmth? Maybe try the cold! Our cold Milk is not fresh. It has been
              sitting
              in a cold storage container for a minimum of 4 years, ensuring that all of the little
              critters inside are dead as dead can be. If you don't like Milk, you probably won't like
              this either.
            </p>

            <p>
              This Milk is not spicy.

            </div>

            <p>Uh oh! You've been MILKED! This Milk is gross and absolutely repulsive. It really is not
              good, and we don't recommend it. That said, some people do like it. Maybe. Honestly,
              this
              Milk is what we've had lying around leftover on the floor.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sometimes this Milk is spicy, but
              mostly due to the dirt.
