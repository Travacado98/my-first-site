          <h1>About Our Milk</h1>
          <p>Milk is a nutrient-rich liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary
            source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able
            to
            digest solid food. Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that
            strengthen the immune system and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. Milk contains many
            other
            nutrients, including protein and lactose.</p>

          <h1>The Truth</h1>
          <p>
            The milk-builds-strong-bones claim was not the first to collapse under scrutiny. In 2005, the
            Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) petitioned the Federal Trade Commission
            (FTC)
            to examine industry advertising claiming that milk could cause weight loss.
            <br>
            <br>
            A multimillion-dollar,
            celebrity-filled ad campaign was based on the findings of a single Tennessee researcher who
            reported
            that, in small numbers of people, dieters who included milk in their low-calorie diet plans lost
            more weight than dieters who left milk out. Other researchers were not able to replicate the
            finding.
            <br>
            <br>
            In response to PCRM’s petition, the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices met with U.S.
            Department of Agriculture staff who oversaw the campaign and representatives of the National
            Fluid
            Milk Processor Promotion Board and the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board who agreed to
            discontinue all advertising and other marketing activities involving weight-loss claims.
            <br>
            <br>
            The
            decision also applied to Dairy Management Inc., which was created to increase demand for
            U.S.-produced dairy products on behalf of America’s dairy product producers.
